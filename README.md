This is a research project on exploring the probability property of scRNA data and some methods for scRNA denoising.

The research is mostly based on the data offered by *Open Problems in Single-Cell Analysis* (https://openproblems.bio/results/denoising/#description). These scRNA data files are too large to be uploaded on Github thus I didn't put them in the repository. If you're interested in them, you can go to *https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1M6g2FuknSV_hH2SQstMWNKRrjx1FIiCA?usp=drive_link*. 
Here is the work done before November. Many of the codes lack comments, which is a problem for everyone (including myself). Perhaps at the beginning of next year, when I have some free time, I will review this work and add the missing comments.

# exploring probability property
The relevant work is in the folder of *proability property verification*. In conclusion, they're (Zero-Inflated ×？)Negative Binomial
